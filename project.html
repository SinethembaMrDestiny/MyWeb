	<h1>GROUP THREE PROJECT</h1>
<br>
	<p>
		As Group three we have decided to do an online voting system for SRC elections since we have seen that over the years,<br> many students have not been voting due to various reasons which include long queues, sometimes unfavourable weather<br> conditions(rain, cold, sometimes windy). We have decided to approach the SRC and put the matter on the table with them<br> so as to ask permissions on the project. We are going to be using PHP, MySQL and javaScrip for coding the project.
